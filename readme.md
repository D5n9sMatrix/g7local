Evaluate det A when A =  1 Solution. The matrix does have zero entries, so expansion along (say) the second row would involve somewhat less work. However, a column operation can be used to get a zero in position(2, 3)â€”namely, add column 1 to column 3. Because this does not change the value of the
determinant, we obtain
